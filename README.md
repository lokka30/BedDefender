BedDefender is a tiny plugin that disables sleeping, and/or respawn point adjustment
(depending on however you wish to configure it). :)

I programmed this to add an extra challenge to Survival servers. Beds allow you to completely skip
night time, only at the cost of 3 planks and 3 wool. Forcing players to survive the night makes the
game more difficult, and therefore, less mundane.

This plugin allows you to:

- Prevents players from entering beds (default), and/or,
- Prevent the re-spawn point from being set at beds (not default).

BedDefender also sends a toggleable, customizable message to players who are prevented from sleeping
in a bed (if enabled, of course).

If you want to make Survival even harder, you should check out my other plugin as well,
[LevelledMobs](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/levelledmobs.74304/)!
